# Giftastic

This application makes use of the GIPHY API and Ajax requests in order to display a series of Gifs that correspond to whichever button the user selects. The theme for this series of buttons is Pokemon, but the user may enter whatever they want for a search term and may add their own buttons. 

Every time a button is selected, several G and PG rated gifs will be displayed below the search bar.
